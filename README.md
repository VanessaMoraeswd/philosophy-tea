üìö About the Project
Welcome to Philosophical Spot ‚Äì your cozy corner for philosophical exploration! This interactive web application is designed for curious minds who want to delve into the thoughts of renowned philosophers. Simply paste your Gemini's API key, ask a question, select a philosopher, and get an answer formulated from their unique school of thought, as if they were philosophizing with you over a warm cup of tea. TPlease notice that the answers are fictional, based on philosophical studies, so they are not real. This app was built for entertainment purposes.
